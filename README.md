# JSON Server Example

## Project Overview
This project is a simple REST API using `json-server`, which allows you to create a full fake REST API with minimal setup. It serves data from a JSON file that holds posts, comments, and a profile. This can be particularly useful for frontend developers who need API endpoints for testing and prototyping.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Once you have Node.js, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install json-server
   ```

3. Ensure you have created the `db.json` file with the given structure if it's not already included in the project.

## Usage
To start the JSON server, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now access your JSON data through the following endpoints:

- Posts: `http://localhost:3000/posts`
- Comments: `http://localhost:3000/comments`
- Profile: `http://localhost:3000/profile`

Add, edit, or delete entries using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Features
- **Easy setup**: Just a single JSON file to define your data.
- **Full REST API**: Supports all standard CRUD operations.
- **Live Reload**: Automatically reloads the server when the `db.json` file changes.
- **Supports Relationships**: You can reference related data (e.g., comments related to posts).

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following npm package:

- `json-server`: A simple way to create a REST API from a JSON file.

To view more about the `json-server` package, visit the [json-server GitHub repository](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Project Structure
The project contains the following important files:

```
/project-folder
│
├── db.json         # The JSON database file used by json-server.
└── README.md       # This README file providing information about the project.
```

The `db.json` file contains the following sample data structure:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "json-server",
      "author": "typicode"
    }
  ],
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "body": "some comment",
      "postId": 1
    }
  ],
  "profile": {
    "name": "typicode"
  }
}
```

Feel free to modify the `db.json` file to fit your data needs or testing purposes.
